<!--
	`ScriptableAreas` are a special type of areas that the `TerjeCore` mod adds.
	Unlike standard areas - scriptable areas can have more flexible functionality, support custom parameters,
	have a power gradient between the inner and outer radiuses, when overlapping multiple areas of the same type - the maximum value at this point is selected.

	SPECIFICATION:
		Areas: list of areas
			Area: each individual area with settings
				Active: (required) Takes the value 0 or 1. Where 0 is disabled, 1 is enabled.
				Classname: (required) Classname of the scriptable area class. See README.md to see list of areas.
